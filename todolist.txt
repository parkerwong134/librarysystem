For the collection table, we need to insert a 'type' column which defines what the item is
such as a book or DVD (refer to the ER model). The 'publisher' column also needs to be added
so we will also need to add a publisher table.

We need to implement how users borrow from the collection. So we first need to make a
'rent/borrow' table that has the collection id and user id as a foreign key. Other
columns might have to include borrow date and return date (dates will then have to
be implemented into the other tables).

We need an event creation page for the admin and an event register page for the user.
For this we also need to create an event table.
